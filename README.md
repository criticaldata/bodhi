# BODHI Framework

**Balanced, Open minded, Diagnostic, Humble, and Inquisitive**

An engineering framework for curiosity driven and humble AI in clinical decision support.

## Overview

BODHI addresses a critical gap in medical AI: large language models often express inappropriate confidence, conflating statistical pattern recognition with genuine medical understanding. Through a dual reflective architecture, BODHI decomposes epistemic uncertainty into task specific dimensions and constrains model responses using virtue based stance rules.

## Key Results

- **97.3%** rate of appropriate clarifying questions (vs 7.8% baseline)
- **+17.3pp** improvement in clinical response quality (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.50)
- **Very large effect sizes** on curiosity (d = 16.38) and humility (d = 5.80) metrics

## Installation
```bash
pip install bodhi-llm
